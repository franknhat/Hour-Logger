# Hour-Logger

I got heavily inspired by my friend who did [what this redditor did](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/101hvnv/oc_i_tracked_every_hour_of_my_life_for_5_years/). In fact, I will heavily use [OP's template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W79a98wLeuMjDbJuy0IYDeQYZSVaWjTUCPUpXj24MHs/edit?usp=sharing) posted in their thread as reference.

Idea on what I want: 
- A front end gui for the app (unsure if will be desktop, web, or mobile app)
  - due to wanting flexability, I will most likly go for JS/TS. Since it can be used in Proton, React, or React native for their respective platforms listed above
  - I shall, however, consider other options since personally I want to try a less familiar language as a learning experience, there are lots of things for me to consider on what I am doing on this project
      - ideally, I would avoid C# since I am using it for work and I want to use something I am less familiar
- each category having their own sub category
- the ability for users to add their own categories, subcategories
- a way to import and export the data
  - too keep it simple I might just save it on a google sheet or excel sheet like as a database for the time being to keep it super simple. Also considering its a side project made mostly for my own self, it does not make sense to use a database
